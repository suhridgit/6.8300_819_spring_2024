The algorithm is initialized by randomly selecting a $3 \\times 3$ patch from the source texture and placing it in the center of the target texture. The boundaries of this patch are then recursively filled until all pixels in the target image have been considered. Implement the Efros and Leung algorithm as the following Python function:\n","```\n","synthIm = synth_texture(sample, w, s)\n","```\n","where `sample` is the source texture image, `w` is the width of the search window, and `s=(ht, wt)` specifies the height and width of the target image `synthIm`. As described above, this algorithm will create a new target texture image, initialized with a $3 \\times 3$ patch from the source image. It will then grow this patch to fill the entire image. As discussed in the textbook, when growing the image, unfilled pixels along the boundary of the block of synthesized values are considered at\n","each iteration of the algorithm. A useful technique for recovering the location of these pixels is morphological dilation, an operation that expands image regions. Specifically, we use `scipy.ndimage.binary_dilation`, `numpy.nonzero`, and/or `numpy.ix_` to recover the unfilled pixel locations along the boundary of the synthesized block in the target image. We have already provided some of the code for this part (which you should not need to modify)."],"metadata":{"id":"PUTDJeCHj_aw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In order to implement `synth_texture()`, you will first write a subroutine that for a given pixel in the target image, returns a list of matching patches in the source texture. This function should have the following syntax:\n","```\n","bestMatches = find_matches(template, sample, G)\n","```\n","where `bestMatches` is the list of matches, `template` is the $w \\times w$ image template associated with a pixel of the target image, `sample` is the source texture image, and `G` is a 2D Gaussian mask discussed below. This routine is called by `synth_texture` and a pixel value is randomly selected from `bestMatches` to synthesize a pixel of the target image.\n","\n","`bestMatches` is a list of patch locations represented by their center pixel coordinates. You should select patches based on both their absolute and relative SSD errors: to be included in `bestMatches`, the SSD error must be below a threshold $\\delta$, and the SSD error must also be below the minimum SSD error times $(1+\\epsilon)$. Efros and Leung use threshold values of $\\epsilon = 0.1$ and $\\delta = 0.3$."],"metadata":{"id":"rSXer6Qukgtl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Note that `template` can have values that have not yet been filled in by the image growing routine.

The purpose of the Gaussian is to down-weight pixels that are farther from the center of the template.
